            Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor
        </h1>
        <p class="classicText">
            The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is the cool kid of American fighter aircraft - a sleek single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter that was born out of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program. Designed to dominate the skies, the F-22 also moonlights as a ground attacker, electronic warfare specialist, and signals intelligence expert. Its proud parents, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, crafted its airframe, weapons systems, wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems, before it spread its wings and took to the skies in 1997.

Initially going by the names F-22 and F/A-22, the aircraft officially became the F-22A in December 2005 when it entered service. However, despite the USAF's original plans to add 750 ATFs to their fleet, only 187 made it into operational status due to high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions (thanks to the military's focus on counterinsurgency at the time), an export ban, and the arrival of the more affordable and versatile F-35. The last F-22 made its grand entrance in 2012, but the Raptor's impressive combination of stealth, aerodynamic prowess, and mission systems have made it a prized member of the USAF's tactical airpower lineup.
