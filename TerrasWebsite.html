        <h2 class="ParagraphHeader">Sukhoi's Su-57; The Life Sized Paper Plane</h2>
        <p class="classicText" >
        The Sukhoi Su-57 (NATO designated name: Felon) is a twin-engine, single seat "stealth" multirole fighter aircraft developed by Sukhoi. It has thrust-vectoring nozzles that, in combination with the aerodynamics of the aircraft, allow it to have super-maneuverability. The thrust vectoring nozzles follow every flap movement the aircraft has, including aileron movements, pitch movements, and rudder movements. The engines themselves generate between 24,054 and 35,556 pounds of thrust (EACH!), allowing it to supercruise. Supercruising means an aircraft's cruising speed is past the speed of sound. The stealth aspects of the plane are there, but the plane itself doesn't have the stealth that the F-22 has. It also contains integrated avionics, and a large internal payload capacity. It's max take off weight is ~77,000 lbs, and it's max payload is ~22,000 lbs. The fuel tank capacity is ~2,700 gallons.

       <h2 class="ParagraphHeader">Why the Su-57 is inferior to the F-22</h2>
       <p class="classicText">
          Even though the Su-57's aerodynamics are a considerable improvement from the Su-35S "Flanker" (not saying the Flanker series was a bad aircraft, but it is an improvement) and rival the F-22's (if not better, even though I doubt that). The Su-57's design has canted vertical stabilisers for stealth, and the trapezoid wings have leading edge flaps, ailerons, and flaperons. Because the aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and large leading edge root extensions that shift the aerodynamic center forward, it increases the static instability and maneuverability. The afore mentioned "extensions" have adjustable leading-edge vortext controllers (or LEVCONs) that are designed to control the generated vortices. This also provides trim and improves high angle of attack (or AOA). The high aerodynamic gives the Su-57 a lot of nose authority, which is important during a rate fight, in which two aircraft that are dogfighting engage in a single turn where they are both trying to get on the others six o'clock and finish the fight. The F-22 is a single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, tactical stealth fighter aircraft that was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). All though it was designed for air superiority, it still has anti-ground, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The aircraft was literally built for air superiority, so it would have an edge over a multi-role fighter. The F-22 was also designed to be a highly difficult to detect and track by radar. In a beyond visual range fight (or BVR for short) it would excel, as it would be very difficult to detect it. Conversely, the Su-57 does not have as good stealth like the F-22 does. The F-22 and the Su-57's full documents and capabilities are classified, so take what I say next with a grain of salt. In a BVR fight, I believe an F-22 would be able to fire a missile before the Su-57 can, and possibly even kill it. Regardless of the low chance, in a close range fight, it would a very close fight between the Su-57 and F-22. Because dogfights are incredibly complicated and detailed I'm not going to be getting into it for now, but I believe even though the Archers which are missiles the Su-57 would have might have an edge over the AIM-9 the F-22 carries, the F-22 would still come out on top solely based on it's maneuverability capabilities. Of course, in the end, it always comes out to the pilots, the plane (for the most part) is only half of the fight.
